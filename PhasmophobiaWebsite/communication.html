            <h3>Spiritual Communication</h3>
            <p>Probably one of the coolest (and scariest) features of the game is that the ghost is always listening to you. To play you have to have some sort of microphone so that you can talk in-game. There are two items that go hand-in-hand with this feature and they are probably the scariest items to use.</p>
            
            <dl>
            <dt>Spirit Box</dt>
                <dd>The spirit box is a very simple item that ends up leading to a lot of tense nerves. This item allows you to hear ghost words. When using it the lights must be off and depending on the ghost, you might have to be alone. Then turn the box on(it will display numbers and make a loud static sound) and begin to ask generic questions such as, "Where are you?", "How old are you?", "Are you angry?"... If you get a response from the box then you have found evidence! You may want to head back to the truck though since talking to the ghost tends to get it angry. Using the ghosts name also might bring quicker responses as well. Sometimes is takes a bit for the ghost to respond, but if it doesn't the box will say nothing detected. If you know you are in the right room then it isn't one of the clues.</dd>
            <dt>Ouiji Board</dt>
                <dd>This item cannot be purchased and is a random (low chance) spawn on maps. It is used the same way as the spirit box, but you don't have to be in the room to get answers. This item will lead to massive drops in sanity(unless dealing with a demon) and can ultimately lead to your death. However, there is one really useful question you can ask and that is, "Where are you?" It will spell out the name of the room it is in. This is great if you can't seem to find it or just want to get right down to business.</dd>
            <dt>Voodoo Doll</dt>
                <dd>This is another random spawn item that can only be found at the farmhouses. Although you don't really communicate with it, taking a picture of it will gets you money. Yet since it is super rare, no one really knows what it does and there are tons of rumors out there.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Talking with the dead can be a scary task but once you get the hang of it... ya no it's alwasy nerve racking. It is good to note that being alone just means you have to be alone in the room. Your buddies can still come into the place with you and stand in nearby rooms. They just might not want to since talking can lead to bad things.</p>
