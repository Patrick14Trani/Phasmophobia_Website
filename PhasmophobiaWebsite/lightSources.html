            <p>Light source items do just as you'd think, provide light. Turning on too many lights on inside the building can overload the breaker so having other light sources comes in handy to navigate through the rooms you keep dark or for when the ghost decides to make things go dark. Some items are even needed to spot evidence! Below is a list of all the light source items and how they work and if they are worth taking. Remeber that being in total darkness is terrible for your sanity.</p>
            
            <dl>
            <dt>Flashlight</dt>
                <dd>The starting flashlight isn't ideal but it's what you get. Visibility from it is limited and if you have better options then take them. Quick Tip: When you have a flashlight in your inventory and you're holding another item, you can press T (default key) to turn your light on.</dd>
            <dt>Strong Flashlight</dt>
                <dd>This flashlight is worth $50 and should be brought everytime when you get one. It allows you to see a good amount in the dark and makes the game far less stressful. Quick Tip: When you have a flashlight in your inventory and you're holding another item, you can press T (default key) to turn your light on.</dd>
            <dt>Lighter</dt>
                <dd>A very small light source, that really only illuminates your hand and nothing else. However, it is needed to activate other items such as the smudge stick and candle. This is only $10 so it doesn't hurt ot bring one.</dd>
            <dt>Candle</dt>
                <dd>A somewhat bright lightsource that can be handy when dealing with a ghost that targets the power often. Requires a lighter to be in your inventory to light. Unfortunatly you cannot place these down neatly and this basically makes it useless. It is only worth $15 dollars and you could hold it like a normal flashlight but otherwise it isn't really worth anything.</dd>
            <dt>UV Light</dt>
                <dd>As a flashlight this item is even worse than the normal one, but better than a lighter. It is provided for you for every mission. It's main function is to locate footprints and fingerprints left behind by the ghost. Unfortunately these don't last forever and require the ghost to interact with things in the map. You can ask the ghost to open doors or turn on/off lights with the in game voice and then attempt to shine the UV on them, but most likely if the ghost leaves fingerprints it will interact with things on its own. Note: Finding footprints does not mean it leaves fingerprints. This is only o you can track the ghosts movements.</dd>
            <dt>Glowstick</dt>
                <dd>This item serves as both a candle and UV light. It lights up a small space but will reveal any prints that its light shines upon. It also offers a permanent lightsource in the room that the ghost can't mess with. It also doesn't interfere with the visibility of ghost orbs. For $20 dollars this item isn't to bad to have especially when dealing with a very active ghost and you don't want to stick around to long.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <p>It would also be foolish to leave out the Power Generator. This key map item is responsible for providing power to the entire building. If switched off you will be unable to turn on any building lights, leaving you to use any of the items above for light sources. Although you should always have a flashlight in your inventory, being in the dark is terrible for sanity and you should make it near priority to turn the generator back on if this happens.</p>
