            <p>Ghosts don't like to be disturbed but that's a ghost hunters job. Since you're going to be disturbing ghosts by barging in to their home, and yelling at them and placing random things around them, they may want to scare and kill you. Below are going to be some items that will keep you alive so you can discturb other ghosts.</p>
            
            <dl>
            <dt>Crucifix</dt>
                <dd>This item is extremely useful when it comes to saving your life. The crucifx prevents the ghost from entering hunting mode in a 4 meter radius. You're not 100% immune but if you place it in the ghosts room, you should be just fine. Be wary though, if the ghost likes to throw or move things, your crucifix is no exception. The crucifix is also very innefective if you don't know where the room is or if the ghost wanders. It is also important to note that the crucifix will not save you once a hunt has already begun.</dd>
            <dt>Parabolic Microphone</dt>
                <dd>The Parabolic Microphone is able to detect sound through walls and over long distances. It works like a mobile sound sensor really and if you're playing by yourself, this item could be pretty useful. The numbers that appear at the top are basically a reading of how loud something is. The closer the sound, the higher the number. This makes it great for finding ghosts in large maps. The reason it may not work well with others is because everyone is making sound. If your buddy opens a door, your micorphone will pick that up or if people talk it will pick that up as well. It is worth its $50.</dd>    
            </dl>
            <p>As stated above, both these devices react to both ghost caused sounds and player caused sounds, so its important to keep that in mind as to avoid any wold goose chases.</p>
