            <p>The tutorial found in Phasmophobia is great for learning the very basic items but once you've completed a few missions you are gonna find that there are plenty more things. 
            The journal in the game gives brief desciptions for each item but here you'll get a more in depth look at how each item fucntions and if it's worth using. The itmes have been split into 
            categories to help break them up into their main functions.</p>
