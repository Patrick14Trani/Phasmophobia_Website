            <h3>Your Paranormal Pals</h3>
            <p>In Phasmophobia there are 12 different types of ghosts that you'll run into. Each one has their own type of personality and set of evidence. At some point in your experience you may even be
            able to tell what kind of ghost it is based solely on how it acts. Beware each ghost has abilities that can lead to your demise if you don't counter them correctly. Ghosts also have randomly generated names and can either be capable of responding to groups or one person. Finally the ghosts feed off of your fear. The lower your sanity meter gets in the game, the more often the ghost will mount attacks.</p>

            <dt id="1">Spirit</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A spirit is the most common Ghost you will come across however it is still very powerful and dangerous..." -Journal
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Stengths: None</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Smudge Sticks will stop it from attacking for a long time</li>
                        <li>Spirit Box, Fingerprints, Ghost Writing</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: I've never really had issues with these. They interact with some stuff and the spirit box should be no problem. Although it says they are common that does not mean you will
                    get this ghost more often.
                </dd>
            <dt id="2">Wraith</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A wraith is one of the most dangerous ghosts you will find. It is also the only ghost that has the ability of flight and has sometimes been known to travel through walls" -Journal
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: Never touches the ground meaning you'll never find footsteps with the UV light</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Toxic reaction to salt - which means that if you place salt in the room it will prevent the wraith from attacking</li>
                        <li>Evidence: Fingerprints, Freezing Temperatures, Spirit Box</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: Hiding from this ghost if it attacks is extremely hard since they just travel through walls. They also rarely will interact with doors so fingerprints normally have to be found
                    on lightswitches or other interactables. 
                </dd>
            <dt id="3">Phantom</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A Phantom is a ghost that can possess the living, most commonly summoned by a Ouija Board. It also induces fear into those around it." -Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: Looking at the Phantom will considerably drop your sanity</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Taking a photo of it will make it temporarily dissappear</li>
                        <li>Evidence: EMF Level 5, Ghost Orb, Freezing Temperatures</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: This one isn't afraid to show itself and in doing so it will drop your sanity a lot. Luckily the evidence is all pretty easy to get early on.
                </dd>
            <dt id="4">Poltergeist</dt>
                <dd>
                    "...known as a noisy ghost who can manipulate objects around it to spread fear into it's victims." - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: The Plotergeist can throw huge amounts of objects at once.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Is almost ineffective in an empty room.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: Spirit Box, Fingerprints, Ghost Orb</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: This ghost is really easy to get. It touches everything it can in its area so if you find a bathroom with every sink turned on or the ghost seems to be touching
                    every little thing then you can pretty much wrap that case up. However it may be the only ghost who's weakness hurts you. If it is in an empty room then you may not be able
                    to tell what you're up against because it has nothing to throw around.
                </dd>
            <dt id="5">Banshee</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A Banshee is a natural hunter and will attack anything. It has been known to stalk it's prey one at a time." - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: A Banshee will only target one person at a time.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: It fears the Crucifix and will be far less aggressive near one.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: EMF Level 5, Fingerprints, Freezing Temperatures</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: These can be pretty scary at higher difficulties were you sanity drains faster since they will be likely to chain attacks. They only target one
                    person though and although that may be listed as a strength it ends up being a weakness. Since only one persons sanity will be dropping horribly it'll be pretty easy
                    to tell what you're dealing with and if you bring Sanity Pills you can stave off attacks for awhile. During an attack it will only go for that one person
                </dd>
            <dt id="6">Jinn</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A territorial ghost that will attack when threatened. It also has been known to move travel at signifigant speed." - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: The farther a victim is, the faster it will move.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Turning off the locations power source will prevent the Jinn from using it's ability.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: Spirit Box, Ghost Orb, EMF Level 5</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: Another really easy ghost you can tell just off personality. It won't do much or respond to anything unless you are directly in its room. It will barely even leave that area since it has
                    no reason to go and switch off the power. Just beware it's ability on bigger maps since you may not have as much time to hide as you think.
                </dd>
            <dt id="7">Mare</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A Mare is the source of all nightmares, making it the most powerful in the dark." - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: Has increased chances to attack in the dark.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Turning the lights on around the mare will lower it's chance to attack.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: Spirit Box, Fingerprints, Freezing Temperatures</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: This one can easily get confused with other ghosts of similiar evidences, however if you notice the ghost only turns lights off and constantly targets the power source
                    on the map then it will most likely be a mare. 
                </dd>
            <dt id="8">Revenant</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A slow but violent Ghost that will attack indiscriminately. It has been rumoured to travel at very high speeds when hunting." - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: Will travel at significantly faster speed when hunting a victim.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Hiding from it will cause it move very slowly.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: EMF Level 5, Fingerprints, Ghost Writing</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: This one is pretty hard to tell via personality since its personality requires it to hunt and it is preferred if that never happens. If you have cameras set up around the place
                    you may be able to see it when it hunts and you can judge its speed but good luck getting someone to be bait. Luckily the evidence here can be gathered pretty quickly assuming you find the room
                    quickly.
                </dd>
            <dt id="9">Shade</dt>
                <dd>
                    "..is known to be the Shy Ghost. There is evidence that a shade will stop all paranormal activity if there are multiple people nearby" - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: The Ghost is harder to find since it is shy.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: The Ghost will not enter hunting mode if multiple people are nearby.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: EMF Level 5, Ghost Orb, Ghost Writing</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: This is easily the hardest ghost to find when playing with friends. Luckily none of you are at risk of dying if you travel together and if nothing is happening at all unless one
                    or no people are present in the house then it is pretty easy to guess as a shade. However, you must be sure you've combed over the whole place first because its possible you are just dealing with a Jinn 
                    and haven't visited his area yet.
                </dd>
            <dt id="10">Demon</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A Demon is one of the worst ghosts you can encounter. It has been known to attack without reason." - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: Demons will attack more often then any other ghost.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Asking a Demon successful questions on the Ouija Board won't lower the users sanity.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: Spirit Box, Ghost Writing, Freezing Temperatures</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: This ghost is not hesitant to show itselt and act up. Finishing missions as fast as possible against demons is paramount. On lower difficulties it won't be as bad since sanity drops 
                    off so slowly, but once you've moved on this will become a nightmare to deal with, especially because it's evidence is closely related to other ghosts. Finding all three pieces as fast as possible
                    is the best way to win. Crucifixes and smudge sticks are a must when dealing with a Demon.
                </dd>
            <dt id="11">Yurei</dt>
                <dd>
                    "A ghost that has returned to the physical world, usually for the purpose of revenge or hatred." - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: They have a very strong effect on people's sanity.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Smudging the room will cause it to not wander around the location for a long time.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: Ghost Orb, Ghost Writing, Freezing Temperatures</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: If everybody's sanity is draining unusually fast then you know it's a Yurei. If you don't want to chance a guess, the freezing room won't be hard to find and then just setting up
                    will get you all the evidence you need. 
                </dd>
            <dt id="12">Oni</dt>
                <dd>
                    "Are a cousin to the Demon and possess extreme strength. There have been rumors that they become more active around their prey." - Journal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unique Strengths: More active when people are nearby and can move objects at great speed.</li>
                        <li>Weaknesses: Since they are so active around people it is easy to find and identify them.</li>
                        <li>Evidence: EMF Level 5, Spirit Box, Ghost Writing</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: Careful not to mistake this one for a Jinn. Be on the lookout for any small random objects getting tossed at high speeds and be sure to get that spirit box response, as terrifying as that sounds.
