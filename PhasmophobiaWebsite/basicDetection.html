            <p>The key part to discovering what ghost you have is to find its "room". The ghost will have a randomly assigned room where they spend most of their time and will reveal to you all the evidence you need. There are a couple items that really come in handy to finding this room as well some basic tactics and audio queues you should be looking for.</p>
            
            <dl>
            <dt>Thermometer</dt>
                <dd>This is by far the most consistent way to find the room. The ghost room is always pretty cold and sometimes freezing. Walking into a room that is constantly under 10&deg;C then that is probably the room.The only reason that it wouldn't be is if the game glitches a bit and thinks you're in a room above or below. Sometimes there are just tiny spots that glitch. Note: The thermometer is always scanning the spot you're standing on. If the temp drops below 0 or you see your breath that means you have freeing temperatures. This item is $30 and a must bring when you can buy it.</dd>
            <dt>EMF</dt>
                <dd>The EMF reader searches for EMF(electromagnetic fields) traces left by certain ghosts and is provided for you every mission. Although not the best way to find the ghost room it certainly comes close second. Anything the ghost messes with will give off some sort of EMF and the ghost itselt will as well. Just because you are picking up EMF signals doesn't mean that the ghost will eventually give you EMF 5, it merely means the ghost is near, or has touched something near. Since they only mess with things in or near their room then you can use thins information to assume you've found the room or are close.</dd>    
            </dl>
            <p>Those are really your best shots at finding the ghost via items alone however you can also call out to it in hopes for response. Using the in game voice chat you can ask the ghost questions such as, "Can you give me/us a sign?" or "Where are you?". Using the ghosts randomly genereated name also helps in stirring it up. Its response to these questions will likely be the opening of a door or a loud creek of the floor near where it is. It may even play with the light a little. If you are still having no luck then and playing with friends, then it may be time to start only sending one person in and see if anything happens. Otherwise start setting up areas you hear floor creeks and hope for the best, but once you gain the Thermometer all these issues should go away.</p>
