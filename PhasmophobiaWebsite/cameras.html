            <p>There are several types of cameras and most are provided for free at each mission. They both serve very different purposes but are necessary for clues and getting a good amount of money.</p>
            
            <dl>
            <dt>Video Camera</dt>
                <dd>The video camera is the main way you are going to find ghost orbs. Once you find the room, you should place a video camera inside. Make sure to turn it on(there will be a green light showing on the back of it. If it is red than it is off.)and then turn out the lights and head back to the truck. The computer screen inside the truck shows all camera feeds, so make sure to switch to the one you just placed anf turn on nightvision mode. Then all you have to do is wait a bit and if a little particle of light crosses the screen anywhere, you found a ghost orb! Be careful though, rarely ghosts can turn off the camera. Note: In multiplayer some players cannot see the ghost orbs. Also note not all ghost leave ghost orbs so if you don't see any for awhile then it is likely you won't or you have the wrong room.</dd>
            <dt>Photo Camera</dt>
                <dd>This little camera is great for getting extra money. If you find a random bone lying around, don't just pick it up. You'll get more money if you take a photo of it first. You should also take pictures of any dirty water(water in a sink that a ghost has interacted with). Finally if you are brave enough, try and get a picture of the ghost itselt. This will require you to draw it out and having a crucifix on hand is always helpful as it will make the ghost do a ghost event rather than attack. The photo camera can only take 5 pictures each mission and these photos are displayed in the journal and the headquarters. Note: The photos you take will look different to your friends due to the game logic behind the camera so if you really want to show them something, a screenshot would be better.</dd> 
            <dt>Camera Stand</dt>
                <dd>This handy tool is great for putting the video camera on if there aren't any good ledges or placement in the haunted room or hall. You can just set the camera on it and make sure you have an open hand to carry it with. If you aren't in vr then when you set it down it will go directly down and facing the way you are.</dd>
            <dt>Head Camera</dt>
                <dd>This item is a bit silly but is technically able to pick up ghost orbs. It's just a matter of having a dsignated camera man who stays behind to watch through all the cameras. It gives you a great perspective of what you're buddies can see and if a hunt is going on and you were lucky enough to be outside then you cna view watch your friends views to see if any of them die.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <p>It is always nice to bring extra of the two main cameras. Extra video cameras means more angles and on harder difficulties you may not know the exact room so setting up cameras in multiple rooms can never hurt. Sometimes one photo camera isn't enough. Somebody could die or not be looking the right way as the ghost appears for a split second. If you have the money, stock up on these.</p>
