            <p>Ghosts in this game are not stagnant beings. They move about the entire building to interact with different things and stalk their new victims. Although motion detecting items won't really help you find the ghosts room, they are quite handy for knowing where the ghost is at the current movent. Below are the items that will help you keep tabs on the ghost's whereabouts.</p>
            
            <dl>
            <dt>Motion Sensor</dt>
                <dd>This item does at it says. It detects motion, all motion. Whether you or the ghost walks through the field, it will go off and you'll hear a distint *beep* if you're in the truck. You can see the field of detection on the display map inside the truck and it will also turn green when someone or something walks through.</dd>
            <dt>Infared Light Sensor</dt>
                <dd>This works the exact same way as the motion sensor except no details are sent back to the truck. Instead a bright light is flashed when something walks through it. This item is near useless unless you're trying to do a budget mission.</dd>
            <dt>Salt</dt>
                <dd>Salt appears to be even more budget than the previous two items. One salt can allows you to place three piles of salt in chosen locations. If the ghost walks through the salt then it will leave an indent inside of it and possibly a footprint. The use of this item is kind of the same as the previous ones; detect motion of the ghost to indicate if you're in the right area or to alert you if it is nearby. However, salt carries one more unique use. If you are dealing with a wraith then it will not attack if salt is placed in the room.</dd>
            <dt>UV Light/ Glowstick</dt>
                <dd>These two items might show footprints of the ghost. You can use these to follow its path which should hopefully lead you to the haunted room.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <p>Although motion may not be the best way to discover the ghosts haunted room, it may be a last ditch alternative if you can't find anything else. Catching ghosts with the motion sensor is also a common side task that is very easy to complete. It is highly recommended that you buy one as soon as you can. These items have been better use to warning me that the ghost is near and if I stay too long it might try to harm or scare me.</p>
