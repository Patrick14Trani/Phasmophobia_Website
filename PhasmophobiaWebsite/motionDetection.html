            <p>Ghosts in this game are not stagnant beings. They move about the entire building to interact with different things and stalk their new victims. Although motion detecting items won't really help you find the ghosts room, they are quite handy for knowing where the ghost is at the current movent. Below are the items that will help you keep tabs on the ghost's whereabouts.</p>
            
            <dl>
            <dt>Motion Sensor</dt>
                <dd></dd>
            <dt>Parabolic Microphone</dt>
                <dd>The Parabolic Microphone is able to detect sound through walls and over long distances. It works like a mobile sound sensor really and if you're playing by yourself, this item could be pretty useful. The numbers that appear at the top are basically a reading of how loud something is. The closer the sound, the higher the number. This makes it great for finding ghosts in large maps. The reason it may not work well with others is because everyone is making sound. If your buddy opens a door, your micorphone will pick that up or if people talk it will pick that up as well. It is worth its $50.</dd>    
            </dl>
            <p>As stated above, both these devices react to both ghost caused sounds and player caused sounds, so its important to keep that in mind as to avoid any wold goose chases.</p>
