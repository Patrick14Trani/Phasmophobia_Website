            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Phasmophobia! If you didn't already know, this game lets you partake in the role of paranomal investigator. Your goal is to go into
            haunted areas and figure out exactly what type of spirit is haunting the place. Be warned, the spirits do not take kindly to disturbance and if you outstay your welcome
            you're likely become one of them.</p>
            <p>The horror game can be unforgiving and quite confusing with the large alotment of gear to choose and just wide range of features within. This website will act as a guide
            to those wanting to learn how to play and may even offer some insights to those who have already braved the perils of the paranormal.</p>
